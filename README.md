# Mobile-Service-Churn
The following is a churn model which predicts the amount of people that will churn from a mobile service plan.

Objective 
Predict the amount of people that will vhurn from the specific mobile service.  

Data Description
The data set contains different services provided by a mobile service company and certain factors that might affect the churning of a user.

Dependent Variable
Monthly Charges, Dependents, Total Charges

Independent Variable
Streaming Services, Senior Citizen, Gender, Tenure, phone Services etc.

Proposed model
Ensemble methods is a machine learning technique that combines several base models in order to produce one optimal predictive model. We will design and implement a cutting edge advanced statistical model using random forest algorithm and get the output for the same technique after that, we use another technique to build a new model using KNN and the third model is build using logistic regression. Then we will compare the result of all these algorithm, finally we will build a new model by combining all these three techniques together (Ensemble Technique).

Alternative model:
To build a new model using deep learning using tensorflow framework techniques for the best prediction result.
